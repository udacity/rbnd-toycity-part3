How long did you spend working on this project?

About 4.5 hours

What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?

Two or three times I felt like giving up, but took a step back and figured it out. Can’t remember the specifics

What two additional features did you build? Why?

I added the ability to capture more personal information. Will be helpful for marketing. Also, added a function to check if stock is low. Out of stock is nice, but low stock warnings are helpful as well.

Where do you still have room to grow?

Given that I wrote my first line of Ruby code on Friday afternoon…everywhere. Hacking on it hard this week.
